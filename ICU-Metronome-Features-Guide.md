# ICU Metronome — Features Guide

## What this is

A compact, interleaved practice metronome that steps up tempos and segments intelligently for practicing rapid passages more effectively—with lasting results.  See the **Resource Links** on the main page for background and guidance from Dr. Molly Gebrian, who developed this methodology.

## Quick start

1. Set **Start Tempo**, **Target Tempo**, **Step Size (metronome increment)**, and **Cycles (how many segments you wish to work at once)**.

2. Adjust **Subdivision** and **Volume**, if desired.

3. Press **Generate** → then **Start**.

4. Use arrow keys to navigate (↑/↓ step, ←/→ cycle).   *(Keyboard legend hidden on small screens.)*

## Controls

- **Generate**: recomputes steps and cycles if you have changed any settings.
- **Start/Stop**: toggles playback.
- **Subdivision:** Quarters, 8th’s, Triplets, 16ths, 5’s, 6’s, 7’s.
- **Do not exceed Target Tempo:** Shortens the final step increment if the next step would exceed the Target Tempo.
- **Start segment:** Pick a segment (ideally near the middle of your set). Cycles will expand outward from that point, providing a variable practice option.  If left blank, cycles will start with segment 1 and add additional segments in forward order by default.
- **Backwards mode:** If checked, cycles start from the final segment and add in reverse. With a start segment selected, backwards mode reverses the usual order of additional segments being added around the start segment.
